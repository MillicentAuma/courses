# Lab 6: Recursion

For this lab, you will write two recursive programs.

1. Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

   $$F_0 = 0 \\ F_1 = 1 \\ F_n = F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}$$

   

Write a simple static function, `int fib(int)`, that returns $F_n$, and write another function that prints the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to *n*.

2. Write a recursive implementation to estimate the following formula for pi, found under *Related Formulas* here:

The skeleton code for this assignment is here: [RecursiveRoot.java](https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/6375/files/340747/download?wrap=1)[![Preview the document](https://ursinus.instructure.com/images/preview.png)](https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/6375/files/340747/download?wrap=1).

For any reasonable *k* (for example, 10), you should get an estimate of a familiar number.

*Roughly equivalent to Lab 2 in CS-174 (CS2) in subsequent years.
