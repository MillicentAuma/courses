# Hello, World

You  may use any text editor for this assignment.  I prefer emacs, but it  requires  getting used to some unusual keystrokes, which can be annoying for beginners.  Linux users may prefer Gedit.  Mac users may prefer  Xcode.  Do not use a rich text editor such as Microsoft Word. To run  Gedit in Ubuntu, open the Terminal and type gedit.  To open (or create) a specific file, type: gedit [filename]. For example: gedit  HelloWorld.java.

To use emacs, just replace gedit with emacs in the command above.

1. (5pts) Write a Java program that prints, "Hello, my name is [your name]." to the screen.  Name is HelloWorld.java.

2. (5pts) Write a Java program called `FloatLinear` that takes three floating point variables, `m`, `x`, and `b,` and prints the result of *y=mx+b.*  More specifically, it prints:

`y =` [value of y]

3. (5pts) Do the same where all of the variables are integers, and  note how the results change.  Call this program IntLinear.  What  changed, and why?

Remember that the name of the class must be the same as the filename.

4. Bonus (5pts): Do all of the above in Python.

Upload your Java files and paste their output into the submission window.
