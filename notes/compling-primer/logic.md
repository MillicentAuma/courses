# Formal Logic and Sets

In this chapter, review some foundational concepts and terminology necessary to communicate clearly.  Many of these concepts will likely be familiar to those with an intermediate knowledge of computer science, an elementary knowledge of discrete mathematics, or a background in linguistics.

**Formal logic** is the study of deduction within formal systems.  The earliest known example of such formal deduction is Aristotelian, or syllogistic, logic.  We concern ourselves here with the basics of propositional and first-order logic, Boolean algebra, sets, and lists.

## Basic Operators

A boolean statement is either true or false, or, equivalently, 1 or 0.  We use **operators** to make more complex statements.  The most fundamental operators are "and," inclusive "or," and "not," represented by the following symbols:
