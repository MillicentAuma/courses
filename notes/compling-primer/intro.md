# Computational Linguistics

## Introduction

These notes are designed as a breadth-first introduction to modern computational linguistics and natural language processing for those with little or no background in the field.  It is particularly suited for undergraduates.  As much as possible, I have endeavored to make the content and explanations accessible to those without an extensive computer science, mathematics, or programming background.  

There are many fine texts in computational linguistics targeting students with advanced training in mathematics, but they are typically filled with unexplained jargon and esoteric mathematical symbols.  This text targets those who would like an in-depth understanding of the material -- enough to continue with further study -- but who may not have advanced mathematical training in probability and statistics, linear algebra, or linguistics. By the end of these book, the reader should be able to understand the denser material.

To the extent possible, I have endeavored to convey the material while making as few assumptions as possible about the reader's background, without sacrificing depth.  As a result, those with extensive background in the requisite areas may find the explanations of early chapters to be belabored.
