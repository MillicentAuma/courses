## Course Description

This course is four credit hours.

This course will provide a practical introduction to the burgeoning field of deep
learning with particular emphasis on applications to language and vision. In the
beginning, students will review fundamental concepts in probability and linear
algebra before proceed through an accelerated introduction to basic machine
learning concepts. From there, students will learn the mathematics behind deep
learning and the latest advances in the context of specific practical projects. In the
latter half of the course, students will present and discuss important scientific
papers in deep learning. A significant portion of this course involves selecting
semester-long project to work on, as an individual or part of a group, culminating in
a research paper and presentation. Students are encouraged to work in groups on
projects that can be submitted to a real workshop or conference. Much of this
class will adopt more of a seminar style of learning than a typical course.

## Topics

We will cover a variety of topics in this course, and some are negotiable, depending
on students’ interest and progress. We will focus more on depth than breadth.
Planned topics* include the following, as much of the knowledge acquired when
learning an area deep learning well can be transferred to another area. At times,
students will be expected to watch a video prior to class and come prepared to
work on an in-class assignment with the professor.

  ## Objectives
  Students will gain practical experience writing deep learning programs to create,
  classify, and analyze images and text.

  Students will develop the confidence to read and present cutting-edge deep
  learning papers.

  Students will gain cognizance of the societal and ethical implications of deep
  learning.

  ## Prerequisites
  Students should be able to write code in a high-level programming language. All
  assignments will use Python 3. Students should be willing and able to learn enough
  Python to complete the assignments that require it. (We will have an initial
  assignment to get students comfortable with Python.)

  While we will review the requisite mathematics in the course, due to the intensely
  mathematical nature of machine learning, this course assumes a reasonable level of
  mathematical maturity. Basic knowledge of data structures will be assumed. We will
  make extensive use of probability and concepts from linear algebra and calculus,
  but this course does not presuppose comfort with such concepts. We will review
  this material in the course.

  This course does not assume previous experience with artificial intelligence.
  This course assumes access to a Unix (OS X, Linux, etc.) environment. It may
  possible to complete the course using Cygwin, but it is not recommended. Students
  whose computer does not have a Unix-based environment should install one in a
  virtual machine. We also have computers available with NVIDIA GPUs for students
  to use.

  ## Approach

  "It doesn't matter what we cover; it matters what you discover."
  -Victor Weisskoph

  From the first day of class, students should think about what they would like to do
  for their final project. This will evolve over the course of the semester.
  Classes vary between lectures, in-class exercises, and discussions. Assignments
  will primarily be shorter programming assignments and practical machine learning
  experiments, and, occasionally, essays. Students may be expected to watch a
  lecture prior to class.

  It is required that students have regular access to a computer and an Internet
  connection throughout this course. If you have a laptop, it would be useful to bring
  the laptop to class, especially for the in-class exercises.

  My philosophy toward this class is that we are not in a rush. How much we cover
  will, in part, depend on the students. While there is material that we must cover, this
  is not a class in which we must "go over" a checklist of materials. This course is an
  exploration. As such, this class is heavily democratized. While I have the final say, I
  will poll students about the special topics we cover.

  ## Weekly Homework

  Every week, there will be homework assignments -- sometimes short programs,
  sometimes written assignments, and sometimes small scientific experiments --
  designed to mentally solidify concepts from the course. Some of these assignments
  may require students to bring their work to class for discussion.
  Programming Assignments*
  Planned assignments are:

  • Text Classification (intro to Keras)
  • Text Generation
  • Machine Translation
  • Image Classification
  • Style transfer
  • Reinforcement Learning

  ## Midterm

  Expected legitimate absences for the midterm must be approved by my at least two
  weeks in advance. This course will have one in-class midterm on October 9 that covers concepts from
  the course up to that point. The midterm will be a project where the student must
  design a deep learning solution to a problem in the allotted class time.

  ## Final Exam

  The final exam will take place on December 13 at 9:00am in the usual classroom.
  Attendance for the final presentation is mandatory. If you expect to have a legitimate
  absence, it is your responsibility to inform me at least a month beforehand.
  The final exam in this course consists of a written report and presentation of a
  course-long project, wherein students design, implement, and analyze a machine
  learning experiment from scratch, using publicly available data. Progress reports will
  occur throughout the semester to ensure that students are making adequate
  progress. The presentations will occur on the final exam date. The papers will be
  due 24 hours prior to the presentation.

  ## Class Participation

  Students are expected to come to class having read the material assigned.
  Students are also encouraged to ask questions of the instructor and of other
  students on the class message board.
  If a class has an assigned video, students are expected to approach it as a class
  reading, watching it prior to class, and come prepared with questions.
  Students are encouraged to post interesting articles relevant to machine learning on
  the message board.
  Students are also expected to complete anonymous (to the instructor) weekly
  surveys regarding their progress in the class and relative interest in topics. Not
  completing these will negatively affect the student's participation grade.
  Students should come prepared for discussions by having read the material.

  Students should always be respectful toward other students. Being disrespectful
  toward others will substantially lower one's participation grade and, depending on
  the severity, may lead to more serious consequences.
  At the start of class, students are encouraged to bring up interesting things they
  have read or heard about in AI/deep learning. Interested students may wish to give
  a brief talk or presentation for extra credit. (See "Extra Credit”).
  At the end of the semester, students are asked to provide anonymous
  feedback on official questionnaires. This is extremely important for the
  college.

  ## Assignment Submission

  The report for the course project must be submitted in LaTeX (with a PDF), using the
  NIPS template. Programming assignment reports must be submitted in LaTeX (with a PDF) using
  the NIPS template. Regular homework assignments should be submitted as a single Markdown file or
  as a zipped LaTeX file (with a PDF).

  ## Late Policy

  Unless the professor explicitly states otherwise otherwise, do not turn in
  assignments late. You should assume that a late assignment will receive no credit.
  Get help before your assignment is late. If you're dissatisfied with what you've
  turned in, talk to me.
  Attendance
  Attendance is mandatory, and attendance will be taken. More than five
  unexecused absences may result in being dropped from the class and/or receiving
  an F for the class. Coming in after we have begun counts half of an absence. If you
  expect to have a string of legitimate absences or late arrivals -- or if you have a class
  CS477 Fall 2018 Grissom
  Ursinus College, Fall 2018 Seminar in Deep Computer Vision and Language
  across campus -- it is your responsibility to let me know at at least two weeks
  beforehand.
  Class Cancellation Policy:
  Class will be cancelled if the college calls an Inclement Weather Day. The hotline is
  610.409.3700 and KYW (AM 1060); the closing number is 429. Should class be
  cancelled for this or any other reason, I will contact the class via e-mail and/or
  Canvas. Assignment due dates are unaffected by weather.

  ## Grading

  • Components of the final grade are as follows:
  • Weekly Homework 10%
  • Programming Assignments 20%
  • Midterm 10%
  • Writing Assignments 10%
  • Final Project 40%
  • Participation 10%

  There will be no dropped grades. If you're dissatisfied with your grade on an
  assignment, see me during office hours.

  ## Extra Credit

  There may be ways to earn extra credit. One easy way is to give a 5-10 minute
  presentation about something interesting in AI or machine learning at the beginning
  of class.  It is possible to earn extra credit by going above and beyond the expectations of an
  assignment. All extra credit is at my discretion.

  ## Troubleshooting
  • When asking the instructor for help debugging, students must provide the
  following:
  • Information about the environment (OS version, compiler/interpreter version, etc.)
  • Error output.
  • Other conditions under which the error is or is not reproduced.
  • Evidence that the student has attempted to solve the problem.

  ## Class Etiquette

  Excessively texting, sleeping, using social networks, or otherwise being disruptive in
  class may affect your participation grade (and, more importantly, your ability to
  follow along).
